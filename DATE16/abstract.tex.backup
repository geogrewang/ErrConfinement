Reliability has become as an important design consideration in nanoscale computing. As the design complexity increases, fault tolerant techniques which guarantee a correct execution achieves significant processing overhead. To address this challenge, recently researchers have proposed approximation techniques compromising the Quality-of-Service across all design abstractions. State-of-the-art techniques in approximate computing are applied during the design phase of algorithm and architecture. In this paper, propose a low cost error correction technique for memories based on data approximation, which exhibits frequently in data and image processing applications. It takes advantage of the similarity of data pattern during data processing, and implies it as a pre-knowledge for online data correction.

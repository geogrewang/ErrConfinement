Introduction
</H1>
With reduced transistor size in deep sub-micron CMOS technology, the performance and power density of processor have increased dramatically. 
High power density on the semiconductor chips increases failure rate and consequently reduces device lifetime as well as causes soft errors&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node17.html#trends_reliability">1</A>].
Furthermore, soft errors are caused by external radiations which are increasingly reported even at ground level&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node17.html#ground_level_signal">2</A>]. 
These trends forced digital designers to treat reliability as a serious design concern. 

<P>
Two major categories of faults, namely transient and permanent faults, lead to unreliability of a design[<A
 HREF="node17.html#ibm:ramp">3</A>]. <I>Transient faults</I> manifest into <I>soft errors</I> which temporarily corrupt the data or the output of a combinational circuit. On the other hand, <I>permanent faults</I> lead to permanent damage of the circuit and manifest as <I>hard errors</I>. Permanent faults are caused by <I>extrinsic</I> sources to the design such as manufacturing defects, process variation or <I>intrinsic</I> sources, which are caused by wearing out of the design material.

<P>
The impact of faults can be investigated through simulation. While faults can be simulated accurately only at the circuit level of abstraction, many proposals exist
to inject the fault at high level of abstraction for early reliability exploration. Pure software fault injection techniques alter the processor state (memory, register) to simulate a fault, however, it suffers from a restricted view of the micro-architecture. Register-Transfer Level (RTL) and gate-level fault injection approaches [<A
 HREF="node17.html#david_fault_injection">4</A>] simulate the hardware behavior with more accuracy 
and therefore, are usually slow and in some cases need repeated compilation. In order to hit a balance, fault injection can be performed during instruction-set simulation (ISS) [<A
 HREF="node17.html#ser_sim">5</A>], [<A
 HREF="node17.html#swat">6</A>], which offers different degrees of accuracy and speed trade-off. In [<A
 HREF="node17.html#WangZISQED13">7</A>], similar accuracies are achieved for ISS and RTL fault injection. Cho [<A
 HREF="node17.html#ChoMCAM13">8</A>] presents a quantitative evaluation on the accuracy of different fault injection techniques by tracking error propagation using FPGA-based emulation system, where the inaccuracy analysis is conducted through exhaustive fault injection experiments.

<P>
In contrast to the simulation techniques, analytical methods have also been proposed to investigate fault tolerant behavior of circuits. Mukherjee et al. [<A
 HREF="node17.html#MukherjeeWERA03">9</A>] introduced 
the concept of architecturally correct execution (ACE) to compute the vulnerability factors of faulty architecture components. In [<A
 HREF="node17.html#BiswasREM07">10</A>], ACE analysis is performed to 
compute architectural vulnerability factors for cache and buffers. Reliability-aware software transformations are proposed by Rehman et al. [<A
 HREF="node17.html#RehmanSKH11">11</A>,<A
 HREF="node17.html#rehman_raise">12</A>] which used the ACE to instruction vulnerability analysis. The vulnerability of the instruction is analyzed by investigating the constituent logic blocks. While the instruction vulnerability index model proposed in [<A
 HREF="node17.html#RehmanSKH11">11</A>] includes the logical masking effects, the 
details of derivation of the masking effect are not mentioned. Wang [<A
 HREF="node17.html#WangZDate13">13</A>] analyze application error rates using instruction vulnerability combined with instruction profiling. Generally, analytical methods suffer from estimation accuracy.

<P>
Even with reliability evaluation techniques, design of reliable system in presence of faults, is still a challenging problem. Designing a reliable processor requires thorough understanding of all the causes of failures such as external radiation, electromigration and thermal cycles. Furthermore, reliability brings forth trade-off with other design dimensions. First, reliability can be traded off with 
area via hardware redundancy. Second, energy and reliability are related via power management and thermal cycling. Besides, performance is affected when reliability requires conservative frequency allocation. This prompted multiple processor design proposals allowing dynamic trade-off between different design constraints taking reliability into account [<A
 HREF="node17.html#razor">14</A>,<A
 HREF="node17.html#ibm:lifetime">15</A>,<A
 HREF="node17.html#kahng_vasco">16</A>,<A
 HREF="node17.html#reinhardt_smt">17</A>]. 

<P>
In recent research reliability is treated as a <I>cross-layer design issue</I>&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node17.html#dehon">18</A>]. This stresses the fact that separate error mitigation techniques from individual design abstractions may result in an over-protected system. The design should take the support of architectural and algorithmic error resilience&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node17.html#hegde_ant">19</A>]. For instance, approximate designs in circuit-level indicates huge power saving [<A
 HREF="node17.html#GuptaMRR13">20</A>]. Algorithmic level error resilience is also frequently observed in image and video processing algorithms, where errors can be tolerated due to limited human perception. In such fields approximate values are sufficient against accurate ones [<A
 HREF="node17.html#mitra_ersa">21</A>], so that Quality-Of-Service (QoS) can be compromised to trade-off other metrics. Huge benefits can be gained from the field of approximate computation. However, it requires strong understanding of the fault propagation through design layers which is extremely difficult to predict the effects of errors through purely fault injection or analytical reliability models.

<P>
In particular approximate error prediction is an issue when <I>algorithmic reliability</I> is explored or when <I>inexact, probabilistic computing</I> [<A
 HREF="node17.html#Palem2013">22</A>] is performed. Similar research was pursued earlier for floating-to-fix point conversion in DSP design [<A
 HREF="node17.html#Keding98icspat">23</A>]. However, there the error localities were restricted to variables (sizes of fixed points) and operators (saturation, rounding effects) without any architecture-level concern. Krishnaswamy et al. proposed a framework called Probabilistic Transfer Matrix (PTM) [<A
 HREF="node17.html#KrishnaswamyVMH08">24</A>] which captures the probabilistic behavior of the circuit while estimates the approximate error probability of faults inside the circuit. Analytical study of error propagation could be potentially addressed using PTM. However, PTM suffers from scalability problem for large design due to its bit-level accuracy and is not initially designed for handling error masking effects.

<P>
In this work we first develop the concept of a new algebraic representation named Probabilistic error Masking Matrix (PeMM) to investigate the masking effects on input errors of the circuits. Compared with PTM, PeMM has a reduced calculation complexity due to the scope of error focusing on coarse-grained signal level. Next we integrate PeMM algebra into a high-level processor design framework and represent logic error as an abstract data structure called <I>token</I>. An automated analysis flow is presented where the token propagation can be accurately predicted using cycle-accurate instruction-set simulator while the error masking effects are carefully addressed using PeMM for individual micro-architecture unit. Fine-grained PeMM is also proposed which calculates error nibble or byte-wise probabilities on data signals. Consequently, the significance of logic faults through design abstractions could be approximately predicted in earlier design phases.

<P>
The rest of the paper is organized as following. Section <A HREF="node2.html#sec:pemm">II</A> illustrates the PeMM algebra in details. Section <A HREF="node9.html#sec:framework">III</A> introduces the approximate error prediction framework in a high-level processor design environment. Section <A HREF="node12.html#sec:case_study">IV</A> shows the usability of proposed framework using several embedded applications on an RISC processor. The paper is concluded and future work is outlined in section <A HREF="node16.html#sec:conclusion">V</A>.

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, a low cost error confinement technique is proposed which exploits the statistical characteristics of target applications and replaces any erroneous data with the best available estimate of that data. The architecture of a RISC processor with custom instructions supporting proposed approach is presented. The benchmarking result shows that the proposed approach achieves far less performance and memory usage overhead than ECC based error detection and correction, while also consumes less energy as image size grows. Further application-level studies using the proposed methodology will be presented in the future.
